### Prerequisites

Content agent requires the following API keys and external services:

#### Package Manager

- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

#### APIs

- [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/signup/)
- [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/)
- (optional) [Google GenAI API key](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
- (optional) [Fireworks AI API key](https://fireworks.ai/login)
- (optional) [Groq AI API key](https://groq.com) - audio/video transcription
- (optional) [FireCrawl API key](https://firecrawl.dev) - web scraping
- (optional) [ExaSearch API key](https://exa.ai) - web search


#### Authentication

- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) account for authentication

#### LangGraph Server

- [LangGraph CLI](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/reference/cli/) for running the graph locally

#### LangSmith

- [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/) for tracing & observability

### Installation

First, clone the repository:


Next, install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

After installing dependencies, copy the `.env.example` files in `apps/web` and `apps/agents` contents into `.env` and set the required values:

```bash
cd apps/web/
cp .env.example .env
```

```bash
cd apps/agents/
cp .env.example .env
```

Then, setup authentication with Supabase.

### Setup Authentication

After creating a Supabase account, visit your [dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/projects) and create a new project.

Next, navigate to the `Project Settings` page inside your project, and then to the `API` tag. Copy the `Project URL`, and `anon public` project API key. Paste them into the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` environment variables in the `.env` file.

After this, navigate to the `Authentication` page, and the `Providers` tab. Make sure `Email` is enabled (also ensure you've enabled `Confirm Email`). You may also enable `GitHub`, and/or `Google` if you'd like to use those for authentication. (see these pages for documentation on how to setup each provider: [GitHub](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-github), [Google](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-google))

#### Test authentication

To verify authentication works, run `yarn dev` and visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). This should redirect you to the [login page](http://localhost:3000/auth/login). From here, you can either login with Google or GitHub, or if you did not configure these providers, navigate to the [signup page](http://localhost:3000/auth/signup) and create a new account with an email and password. This should then redirect you to a conformation page, and after confirming your email you should be redirected to the [home page](http://localhost:3000).

### Setup LangGraph Server


After your LangGraph server is running, execute the following command inside `apps/web` to start the Open Canvas frontend:

```bash
yarn dev
```

On initial load, compilation may take a little bit of time.

Then, open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser and start interacting!

## LLM Models

Open Canvas is designed to be compatible with any LLM model. The current deployment has the following models configured:

- **Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku ðŸ‘¤**: Haiku is Anthropic's fastest model, great for quick tasks like making edits to your document. Sign up for an Anthropic account [here](https://console.anthropic.com/).
- **Fireworks Llama 3 70B ðŸ¦™**: Llama 3 is a SOTA open source model from Meta, powered by [Fireworks AI](https://fireworks.ai/). You can sign up for an account [here](https://fireworks.ai/login).
- **OpenAI GPT 4o Mini ðŸ’¨**: GPT 4o Mini is OpenAI's newest, smallest model. You can sign up for an API key [here](https://platform.openai.com/signup/).

If you'd like to add a new model, follow these simple steps:

1. Add to or update the model provider variables in `packages/shared/src/models.ts`.
2. Install the necessary package for the provider (e.g. `@langchain/anthropic`) inside `apps/agents`.
3. Update the `getModelConfig` function in `apps/agents/src/agent/utils.ts` to include an `if` statement for your new model name and provider.
4. Manually test by checking you can:
   > - 4a. Generate a new artifact
   > - 4b. Generate a followup message (happens automatically after generating an artifact)
   > - 4c. Update an artifact via a message in chat
   > - 4d. Update an artifact via a quick action
   > - 4e. Repeat for text/code (ensure both work)
